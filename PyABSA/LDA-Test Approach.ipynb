I find I need a phone . This phone is very good for meeting the need for one . It ' s the right size for me , too , especially if I have to hold it up to my ear for a long period of time . If this happens a lot in the future , I ' ll use my Bluetooth earphones . I did hear that the Jan 2023 update messed Bluetooth connectivity up a bit for use in cars . I ' ll be getting a car with this capability in a couple of months , so I hope that is resolved by then . Unlike my previous Pixel 3a , it ' s waterproof , has an updated OS with improved features ( the pictures are better even though the camera is supposed to be the one used since the Pixel 2 , the Android Assistant is really good , and the shortcuts are convenient - - and programmable ! - - for the most - used features so one can pull the phone out and be taking pictures in about a second now ) and it makes much better use of the available space for the screen . The response is noticeably better than the Pixel 3a , perhaps at the cost of the battery life . The 3a lasted at least a week for me , versus four or five days for the 6a . There were more initial problems with connection reliability than the 3a had , but the 3a didn ' t have 5G support . Maybe there are still growing pains with 5G . I note that the 4G 3a had consistent 4 bars where the 6a struggles to get 2 at the same location , but the phones would use WiFi more than cellular connections there . There may be some provider issues ; I ' m happy with the phone itself . I liked the earphone plug in the 3a , but strangely I don ' t miss the lack , and if that helps the waterproofing of the phone I ' m all for it . The new phone recognizes its orientation much faster than the 3a did , even though I do not have the facial recognition feature enabled for this purpose . But I do miss the fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone . The one on the front embedded in the screen feels like a gimmick . It ' s slower to successfully recognize me , and seems faster at acknowledging failures . I did add my thumb this time ; any other finger required two hands to log on to the phone . And maybe it is a security feature , but this OS requires a keypad code a lot more often than the Pixel 3a OS . The Android OS has continually improved safety features with each new version . I ' m not happy that the OS will not be updated after three years , but I do like the five - year security support .\n","[2023-02-20 13:13:28] (2.0.27) Example 0: I read many reviews before buying this . I waded through endless nonsense about playing games and taking selfies to get to factors I needed : voice calls , texts , email , and other apps that actually get things done , and maybe the occasional video or music app . I had high hopes , but I ’ m running into a lot of disappointment so far . Transitioning to stock Android 12 from stock Android 10 was easy . The Pixel ’ s cable and built - in instructions helped import all my old apps , often with settings and data intact . I had to re - enter a few passwords , tweak some settings , etc . but it was far less work than I expected . The immediate Android 13 upgrades were easy , although slow . Some companies make ruggedized , military - grade phones . This isn ’ t one of them , in fact it uses mostly midrange materials . So of course I use a case and screen protector . Well , they say all newer Google phones have a hard time recognizing fingerprints , especially with a screen protector . I set the finger sensitivity to high . No difference . Stored multiple recordings of the same fingerprint to enhance recognizability . No difference . The only help I found came from other reviewers , one of whom suggested rubbing the fingertip on his face to pick up skin oil , or another who advised licking the fingertip to make it wet . These are the low - tech solutions to Google ’ s high - tech design failure . Bottom line : an in - screen sensor is a stupid idea and its performance is just as bad as you ’ ve heard . Maybe you ’ ll get lucky , but be prepared to enter passwords or codes or patterns or some other unlock method . It seems to use power quickly , and definitely charges more slowly than my older , cheaper phone , regardless of charger or cable . No wireless charging and nothing like any kind of actual “ fast ” charging . We have an app through our phone company to locate all phones in the family . It can find a Nokia or Samsung to within 50 - 100 feet . But it struggles to locate this phone at all , and then only to within about 1000 feet , indoors or outdoors . The phone has multiple setting options for location precision , permission , GPS vs . Wifi vs Bluetooth , etc . I ’ ve checked Google help and user forums , phone company help and user forums , reviews etc . Nothing helps , and this is a big deal to me . I used my old phone to listen to music , mono speaker and all . It had a headphone jack of course , and an app to tune in FM radio . You could plug in studio - quality headphones . The Pixel speakers are stereo , but not nearly as loud . There ’ s no FM radio and the headphone audio via USB is lower than headphones plugged into an audio jack on the old phone . A scam to force people to buy expensive Bluetooth headphones and headsets when they already own wired versions of both . The Pixel 6A is a bit narrower than my old phone , which makes the Gboard virtual keyboard narrower ; and individual letters seem even narrower than they need to be . So it ’ s harder to type on . I have not tried experimenting with an external USB keyboard , or any other USB “ on - the - go ” function . There ’ s reportedly no good way to view this phone on an external monitor , unlike most Samsungs for instance . Its chips are faster than my old phone and it has more working memory . I ’ m gradually getting used to the finicky “ upgraded ” Android 13 gesture system , which is better for some actions and worse for others . The phone size suits my needs , it has 5G and high - speed wifi which are definite upgrades . I haven ’ t used it much for pictures or video but it seems competent for those . I was recently at a meeting where people were discussing complex topics , so I tried out the recorder app so as not to miss anything . It not only picked up faint voices pretty well , it also transcribed them to text in real time , with varying levels of accuracy . So there are a few pluses , and I ’ ll live with the phone . But I ’ ll keep my eyes open for some better alternative , rather than waiting a few years for the software support to end . This is not what I wanted when making this purchase , so with all things considered , it is disappointing .\n","[2023-02-20 13:13:31] (2.0.27) Example 0: As a preface I did buy this Pixel 6a from Amazon at an amazing budget phone price . I have a still functioning Moto G7 that other than the camera I thought was a way better bargain but wasn ' t supported by Motorola anymore . This Pixel 6a is almost a flagship phone that has what some would consider drawbacks but in many opinions other than mine is a great little phone . My logic in purchasing it is as follows . It ' s a Google phone and the Android OS is theirs and it is as clean as can be with the latest Android 13 on it and it ' s going to be supported for at least 4 years with timely updates . It ' s battery life is good , reception and audio very good and it has a sharp Old display and plenty responsive . The camera combined with the Google software rivals the best and it has a fast processor and more than adequate onboard memory for most people . I like the size of the phone since I am not a large person and the screen is plenty large for me . Games and videos do well on it as it is fine for all but the most very demanding ones . And it is not overly heavy , fits in to a pocket and is well made . For some there are disadvantages such as no wireless charging , no macro or telephoto or wide - angle camera lenses , and although water resistant not 30 minute type and the response is an ok 60hz . But such features require more than twice as much as I paid for it and some of the more expensive phones \" features \" don ' t perform that well . It ' s well worth considering even at full price .\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["c:\\Users\\uditg\\anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\pyabsa\\tasks\\AspectTermExtraction\\prediction\\aspect_extractor.py:651: UserWarning: Implicit dimension choice for softmax has been deprecated.

I purchased this 6A to replace my beloved 2019 Motorola edge . I realized that waterfall screen phones may seem kind of a smirky passe gimmick these days . . . But if you have never held the ORIGINAL 2019 Motorola edge in hand you can ' t truly appreciate how beautiful that phone really is . . . It is nearly 90 % screen with no side bezels a tiny forehead and a minuscule ' s chin . Specs wise , even though this 6A appears to be superior ( barely ) . . . in real world performance , this is not exactly the case . . . The moto edge ' s 765g is a surprisingly competent mid - range chip that rarely disappoints and often impresses . If I were to compare it with Google ' s own Tensor chip you ' d be hard pressed to find any real world differences . . . In fact , as it ' s well known , Google ' s chip tends to run warmer and don ' t seem to be as power efficient . . . I have to be really honest in a direct spec wise comparison even though Google ' s pixel ' s specs are superior DO to being latest technology they don ' t seem to perform any better than the previous tech of other manufacturers . I have experienced the checklist of issues others have had with Google ' s pixel 6 phones . If I were to pick a particularly annoying one it ' s the infuriating poor fingerprint sensor , which is completely useless in full daylight and has trouble recognizing fingerprints from different angles . . . If I were to pick a percentage I would say that it fails 60 % of the time . . . And as you can imagine that is abysmal compared to literally $ 150 phones that have more competent fingerprint readers . But it goes beyond that . I eventually decided to leave my beloved motto edge because I felt that it ' s current specs were causing me app misbehavior . ( As well as it having a slightly cracked screen ) But in truth , it seems that these bugs and mishaps were really related more to the apps themselves than they were to the phone . As this phone seems to suffer the same or similar hiccups . . . Even more bizarre is that most of these hiccups appear to be suffered by Google ' s own apps . . . It would take a book for me to describe all my dissatisfactions with the performance of this phone . So much so that I don ' t really see it so much as an upgrade as merely a replacement for a phone that I loved that was unfortunately outdated by time and made no sense to repurchase even though it was available at a superior price to this one .\n","[2023-02-20 13:13:44] (2.0.27) Example 0: 8 / 10 / 2022 : So far , I ' m still really enjoying my Pixel . A solid 4 . 5 out of 5 . The biggest drawback so far is one I didn ' t mention originally : the charging time . It ' s not BAD , necessarily , but still slower than my previous 4 - year - old phone . It takes about an hour to charge from 0 % to 80 % . The battery life hasn ' t been an issue , at least ; I can get through a day on about 60 % charge . I ' ve gotten used to the fingerprint sensor , though it is still a little finicky . Regarding overheating , I regularly work in 90 - 110 degrees Fahrenheit for several hours at a time , and I haven ' t had any glaring issues . It just gets a little draggy when it ' s hot . ( And apparently , it won ' t let you use the flash when it ' s warm . ) One great thing I didn ' t mention before are the haptics / vibration . I particularly like them in this phone for typing , etc . I can always feel it in my pocket when I ' m getting a call , which I can ' t say for the last few phones I ' ve had before this one . 8 / 1 / 2022 : I ' ve had this phone for only a couple of days now , but my first impressions are very positive . My previous phone was the Essential PH - 1 , which now has a shot battery , and my biggest struggle in finding a replacement for it was finding a device that was the right size . There are plenty of great phones for this price range out there , but almost all of them are all HUGE . Funnily enough , there ' s already a great review by another previous Essential PH - 1 user , so I ' ll probably end up repeating a few of the same points . THE PROS : - The camera experience is MUCH better on the Pixel than with the PH - 1 . Google phone cameras have never failed me . - The stock - feeling Android experience is great and super snappy on the Pixel , and rather customizable . I love being able to activate dark mode on all of my standard apps . Besides that , it will be receiving updates for 5 more years . - The phone design is sharp and the Sage color is unexpectedly cool . The back feels like glass but is made of plastic , which obviously helps to make the phone feel as lightweight as it does . The buttons are nice and clicky . - I use Straight Talk as my carrier . So far , reception has been great , even compared to the Essential PH - 1 . - The size is NEARLY 100 % PERFECT , but it borders on being just a touch on the tall side . I still like the shape enough that I don ' t mind a bit . I have medium - large hands , and I really wanted to stay with a slim device that fits comfortably in one hand and thrives with single - thumb use . - Some are concerned about the phone ' s 60 hz refresh rate . I ' ve never actually owned a phone with anything higher , so as far as I ' m concerned , the display is buttery smooth . THE MEH : - So far , I haven ' t experienced any overheating or bugs . . . with one exception . For whatever reason , my Pixel did not ship with the Magic Eraser tool in the photo editing app . - Battery life isn ' t exactly life - changing , but it ' ll get you through a full day ' s use after an hour ' s charge , no problem . Even intensive use doesn ' t seem to drain the battery too quickly . - The dual speakers are nice , but I noticed max volume is comparatively sorta quiet . THE CONS : - My only real nitpick with this phone so far is the front / display fingerprint sensor . After owning a device with a rear fingerprint sensor , it feels like a bit of a drawback . The PH - 1 ' s rear sensor provided instant unlock , whereas the Pixel ' s front sensor is barely slower AND a little finicky ; sometimes , it takes a couple of tries for it to recognize my thumbprint . It works decently enough even with a screen protector , but like any fingerprint sensor , I wouldn ' t expect great results if your fingerprint is worn away at all . - It comes with a usb - c to usb - c charging cable , but no charger block . I highly dislike that trend . OVERALL , I am really enjoying the phone and hope it does hold out well for the next 5 years of updates . Even with my small nitpick concerning the fingerprint sensor , I love the camera , the lightweight Android experience , and especially the phone ' s size .\n","[2023-02-20 13:13:47] (2.0.27) Example 0: I tried to go budget with the 6a 128gb , but then I was dropping calls like it was the ' 90s ; I had a 100 % fail rate three calls in . After dialing * 611 , two transfers and like . . . 45 minutes , Verizon said it was because my sim card from my old phone was \" incompatible , \" and they just remotely kicked me and my new phone off their network because they are incompetent . That gave me some time to reflect on the fact that I just needed more room and I / really / didn ' t mind switching carriers for a locked phone deal and a sparkly new compatible sim . I ' m happy with my decision because I tend to leave lots of apps running and have lots of tabs in chrome , and even brand new , the 6a had a little trouble managing that . In particular , the developer options section in settings would lag and freeze , even when I was just scrolling through and had closed most other apps . If you put your phone through a lot , consider going with the 7 or better for the processing capabilities . The only thing I preferred about the 6a was the slightly smaller size ; I have smallish hands and it fit them better . Also . . . if you ' re trying to decide whether to move your physical sim from your old phone or to download an e - sim , you should probably just go the e - sim route . Once I had a new sim ( my new carrier sent me a physical one , so I just used that despite my younger sister ' s disdainful laugh at the thought ) , the Pixel 7 handled phone calls perfectly .\n","[2023-02-20 13:13:52] (2.0.27) Example 0: I bought this Pixel 6A for my son as it was an affordable budget option that doesn ' t skimp on features .
